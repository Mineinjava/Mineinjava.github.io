excerpt: "After three successful static fires, we loaded up a full
rocket motor, integrated it, and launched. The nozzle blew out."

My friend and I have been trying to synthesize rocket fuel. The next
step in making our own rocket is integration into a body. After some
research, bentonite clay seemed like a good nozzle material.

Erosion resistance looked promising:

We tried three static fires. All of them worked well with the
bentonite, so we loaded up a full rocket motor and integrated it into a
rocket.

The nozzle blew out on the pad. Apogee: 3". I think it is because we
were unable to consistently press the bentonite into the PVC motor tube.
