Model rocket motors are expensive, so a friend and I decided to make our
own fuel from potassium nitrate and sucrose (KNSU). We followed the
method used by [James Yawn](https://www.jamesyawn.net), which gave us a
start on both safety and procedures.

The initial fuel attempts were a bit rough. We used stump remover of
questional quality as an oxidizer.

Our cooking method was also far from optimal:

We weren't harmed, possibly because of the lack of oxidizer strength. We
bought some higher quality potassium nitrate on Amazon (I'm stil
suprised that it is sold). We also used an old camping pot to cook the
propellant. These upgrades made the propellant much more exciting:

Even at atmostpheric pressure, this propellant was far more powerful. To
get KNSU to burn hotter and faster (better for rockets), we needed to
increase the pressure.

3d-printed ABS is not a good nozzle material.

The nozzle flew out of the rocket, bounced off the fence, and landed
behind the rocket. Good thing we were wearing safety glasses.

Clearly, we need a better nozzle. I am working on getting the lathe at
school up and running so that we could cut one out of a stronger and
more heat resistant material.
