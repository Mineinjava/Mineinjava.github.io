My 2.5" FPV drone crashed into a stream and I would like to replace it.

I think it's time for me to build a 5" quad.

I am using the TBS Source 1 v5 frame and EMAX Eco II 2207 1700kV motors,
mostly due to their high performance/cost ratio.

I have some experience soldering, so the tiny wires are pretty easy. The
large 10awg wires were far more difficult, especially because they had
to be twisted.

Building the drone was fairly straightforward. Everything is documented
pretty well, instructions are great.

Time for the first flight!

It flies!

After a few flights the VTX antenna connector snapped off. I had to
replace the entire VTX, but I redesigned the antenna mount to avoid
this issue in the future.
