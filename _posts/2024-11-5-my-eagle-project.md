My interest in electronics inspired me to earn my Technician and General
Ham radio licenses two years ago. This led me to design an Eagle Project
with Walnut Creek Community Emergency Response Team (CERT). I became
CERT trained last February. 

The purpose of my Eagle Project is to train more Scouts in Ham radio,
especially in disaster reponse. I worked with CERT to offer a Ham class
and raised over $1000 to support CERT including the purchase of radios
to be lent out to scouts.
