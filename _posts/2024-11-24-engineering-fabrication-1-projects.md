This semester I am taking my school's Engineering/Fabrication (EFAB) 1
class. Next semester I will take both EFAB 2 and EFAB 3. Here are the
projects that I have completed.

### Cardboard Arcade (group project)
My group built a cardboard foosball game.

I had COVID for most of the time that we were building. 

### Initials (individual)
This project serves to teach people how to use basic tools. I tried to
push myself by making bow ties. The bow ties didn't fit perfectly because
they were cut by hand (no jig).

### Toolbox (individual)
Again deciding to push myself, I included a drawer in my toolbox. It
works.

### Picnic Table (group project)
This is one of the largest projects I have worked on. My group of seven
built a picnic table out of 2x6 redwood.

### Fusion tutorials (individual)
EFAB 1 focuses mostly on tool use, EFAB 2 on problem solving, and EFAB 3
on communication with a client. Autodesk Fusion is my teacher's
preferred CAD program. We are assigned 30 tutorials to watch and model.

I already know Fusion because of my participation in robotics, so I took
the opportunity to learn Onshape.

#### Christmas Tree (individual)
Because I finished the Fusion tutorials and the picnic table early, I
manufactured one of my CAD models: the Christmas tree.

### Cutting Board (individual)
Another project in the last week of school before finals.
